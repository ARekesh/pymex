PYMEX package is a collection of modules providing tools for accessing interaction
data distributed by IMEx Consortium partners as well as for parsing, transformation
and construction of PSI-MI endorsed interaction data files. Pymex currently supports
PSI-MI XML 2.5.4 (aka MIF 2.5.4) and also a simple DXF 1.5 data exchange format
native to this package.
